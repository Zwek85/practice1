<h2> Kaeden Tun </h2>
This is my developer story.

<ol>
<li>I got interested in computers as a child when my cousin taught me Microsoft Office and when we played games on the computer together. </li>
<li>In High School, I used the computer mainly to do homework and projects. </li>
<li>Throughout college, I learned how to do more things on computers like creating graphs on excel and extracting/compiling data using excel and data extraction software like tableau. </li>
<li>During my gap year after college, I got interested in coding/ programming when I saw some of my coworkers utilizing platforms that were created by using programming languages to develop healthcare related applications </li>
</ol>
